# Enforcement Process

This document outlines how Code of Conduct reports are handled.

## Contacts

- Primary: <james@flyingrobots.dev> (actively monitored).
- Backup/rotation: <conduct@flyingrobots.dev>. If the primary contact is unavailable, the backup assumes lead reviewer.

## Intake and Acknowledgment

1. Reports may be sent to either contact. Include links, context, and any evidence (screenshots, messages).
2. Acknowledgment target: within 3 business days. If you do not receive acknowledgment, email the alternate contact.

## Review

1. Two reviewers (primary + backup when possible) assess the report for scope and severity.
2. The reporters' identity is kept confidential unless explicit consent is given to share it for resolution.
3. If a reviewer has a conflict of interest, they must recuse; the remaining reviewer may recruit an additional maintainer.

## Resolution Timeline

- Initial fact-finding: within 7 business days of acknowledgment.
- Decision and action: within 14 business days of acknowledgment when feasible. If more time is needed, reporters receive weekly status updates.

## Possible Actions

- No action; request for more information.
- Private warning.
- Temporary or permanent ban from community channels (GitHub, Discord, Slack, mailing lists, events).
- Removal from project roles or revocation of permissions.
- Referral to hosting platforms or event organizers if safety is at risk.

## Appeals

Responders may appeal a decision within 14 days by writing to both contacts. A separate maintainer (or external advisor if available) will review the appeal and respond within 14 business days.

## Record Keeping

All reports and outcomes are logged in a private maintainer record with minimal necessary details to track repeat offenses while protecting reporter privacy.
