# [P2.19] Package ninelives-control crate

## Summary

Expose the control-plane surface as a stable, documented module. Crate split will happen in P7; for P2 we ship it inside the main `ninelives` crate with clear re-exports and docs.

## Steps
1. Ensure control-plane modules are exported via `ninelives::control` and mentioned in README.
2. Document feature expectations (none required for core control plane).
3. Capture future split plan for P7 so consumers have a stable path.

## Ready When
- [x] Control plane available under `ninelives::control::*` (router, commands, registry, transports).
- [x] README references control plane usage and stability expectations.
- [x] Note recorded that crate split will occur in P7 with compatibility story.

## Test Plan

### Unit Tests
- [x] `ninelives::control` re-exports compile (covered by existing tests in [`tests/`](tests/)).

### Integration Tests
- [x] Control-plane integration covered by existing tests ([`tests/transport_router.rs`](tests/transport_router.rs), [`tests/command_context.rs`](tests/command_context.rs), etc.).

### End-to-end Tests
- N/A
