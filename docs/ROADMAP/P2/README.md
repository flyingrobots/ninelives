# Phase 2: The Control Plane

**Status:** ✅ Completed

## Executive Summary
*   **Story:** Static configuration is brittle in dynamic environments. To operate reliable systems, we need "knobs and levers" that can be adjusted at runtime without restarting the application. This phase builds the command-and-control infrastructure that allows operators (and eventually the Sentinel) to tune policy parameters live.
*   **Outcome:** A secure, interactive control plane where `Adaptive<T>` configuration handles can be inspected and modified on the fly via a standardized command interface.
