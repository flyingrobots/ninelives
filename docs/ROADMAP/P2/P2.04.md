# [P2.04] Adaptive integration: Timeout duration

## Summary

Make TimeoutPolicy duration adaptive so live updates change the timeout budget for new requests.

## Steps
1. Add tests: shorten duration causes timeout, then lengthen to allow completion
2. Ensure duration read per-call, not cached
3. Doc adaptive getter

## Ready When
- [ ] Timeout adaptive tests demonstrate shorter then longer durations
- [ ] Docs updated

## Test Plan

### Unit Tests
- [ ] duration=200ms with 300ms op -> timeout; update to 500ms -> same op succeeds afterwards
- [ ] Changing duration mid-flight does not affect in-flight call (only subsequent)
- [ ] Setting duration below MIN or above MAX handled per implementation (expect clamp/error)

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Control-plane update to duration reflected in behavior

### End-to-end Tests
- N/A
