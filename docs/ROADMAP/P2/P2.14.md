# [P2.14] Transport abstraction design (HTTP/gRPC friendly)

## Summary

Transport abstraction design for HTTP/gRPC friendliness (types + traits).

## Steps
1. Define transport trait/s (request/response mapping)
2. Document wire formats
3. Prepare for adapters

## Ready When
- [ ] Design doc/traits checked in
- [ ] Examples show mapping to HTTP JSON

## Test Plan

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Trait compiles with router types
- [ ] Serde models for payload compile

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Mock transport adapter compiles against trait

### End-to-end Tests
- N/A
