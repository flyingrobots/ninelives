# [P2.03] Adaptive integration: Retry max_attempts/backoff/jitter

## Summary

Wire Adaptive into RetryPolicy (max_attempts/backoff/jitter) so live updates take effect for subsequent calls.

## Steps
1. Add tests showing max_attempts change affects retry count
2. Verify backoff/jitter adaptives read per-attempt
3. Doc how to fetch adaptive handles

## Ready When
- [ ] Retry adaptive tests pass for max_attempts/backoff/jitter
- [ ] Docs updated with handle access example

## Test Plan

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Start with max_attempts=1; update to 3; subsequent requests perform 3 attempts using deterministic failing service
- [ ] Update backoff delay mid-run changes computed next delay (mock clock/backoff)
- [ ] Updating jitter handle alters delay distribution (use deterministic RNG)

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Control-plane style write-config updates max_attempts and is honored

### End-to-end Tests
- N/A
