# [P2.16a] AuthorizationLayer Structure

## Summary

Define the `AuthorizationLayer` struct and its corresponding `AuthorizationService`. This sets up the middleware boilerplate for extracting authorization logic from the router.

## Steps
1.  Create `AuthorizationLayer` struct holding an `AuthRegistry` or provider.
2.  Implement `tower::Layer` for it.
3.  Create `AuthorizationService<S>` struct.
4.  Implement `tower::Service` boilerplate (poll_ready calls inner).

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Layer and Service structs defined and compile.
- [ ] Service wraps an inner service.

## Test Plan
- [ ] Basic compilation check.
