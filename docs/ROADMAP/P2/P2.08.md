# [P2.08] CommandHandler trait (tower::Service<CommandContext>)

## Summary

Define CommandHandler trait as tower::Service<CommandContext>.

## Steps
1. Create trait alias/type
2. Add blanket impl sanity test
3. Doc contract (poll_ready/call)

## Ready When
- [ ] Trait compiles with tower Service bounds
- [ ] Docs describe poll_ready/call expectations

## Test Plan

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Compile-time test using a dummy Service implementing CommandHandler
- [ ] ServiceBuilder with CommandHandler trait object type-checks

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Router can be built with a mock CommandHandler service

### End-to-end Tests
- N/A
