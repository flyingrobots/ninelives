# [P6.01b] Adaptive Shadow Support

## Summary

Extend `Adaptive<T>` to support a separate "shadow" value alongside the "primary" value.

## Steps
1.  Modify `Adaptive<T>` internal storage (e.g., `ArcSwap<ConfigState>`).
2.  Add `set_shadow(val)` and `get_shadow()` methods.
3.  Ensure lock-free access.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] `Adaptive` holds two values.
- [ ] Shadow value can be read independently.
