# [P6.01c] Shadow Isolation

## Summary

Ensure shadow execution is isolated and does not block the primary path.

## Steps
1.  Use `tokio::spawn` (or similar) for the shadow future.
2.  Ensure panic in shadow doesn't crash primary.
3.  Add basic error handling for shadow path.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Shadow runs concurrently/detached.
- [ ] Primary path unaffected by shadow panic.
