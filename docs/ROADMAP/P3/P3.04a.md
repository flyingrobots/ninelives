# [P3.04a] AIMD Logic

## Summary

Implement the AIMD (Additive Increase, Multiplicative Decrease) math as a `ControlLaw`.

## Steps
1.  Implement `AimdLaw` struct.
2.  Implement `calculate()`: +1 on success, *0.5 on overload.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Math logic implemented correctly.

## Test Plan
- [ ] Unit tests for the math.
