# [P3.02b] TelemetrySink Implementation

## Summary

Implement the `TelemetrySink` trait for `TelemetryAggregator` to ingest `PolicyEvent`s and update metrics.

## Steps
1.  Implement `TelemetrySink::record`.
2.  Match event type (Success/Failure).
3.  Update corresponding window in the map.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Events update the windows.
- [ ] Error counts and success counts tracked separately.

## Test Plan
- [ ] Feed events, verify metrics match.
