# Phase 5: The Sentinel (Self-Healing Brain)

**Status:** 📋 Planned

## Executive Summary
*   **Story:** Reflexes (Phase 3) handle immediate threats, but complex systems require intelligence. We need a "brain" that can observe long-term trends, execute sophisticated logic, and orchestrate coordinated responses. The Sentinel introduces a scriptable meta-policy engine that acts as an autonomous operator within the system.
*   **Outcome:** A programmable self-healing engine where operators can define complex, high-level reliability rules (e.g., "if region A degrades, shift traffic to B") that run automatically, reducing the need for human intervention during incidents.
