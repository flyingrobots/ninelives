# Phase 9: Distributed Patterns

**Status:** 📋 Planned

## Executive Summary
*   **Story:** Resilience isn't just about a single service; it's about the entire fleet. We combine all the previous building blocks—Shadowing, Sentinel, Fork-Join, Adaptive Policies—to implement high-level, enterprise-grade distributed system patterns. This is where the "Lego blocks" come together to build castles.
*   **Outcome:** Turn-key recipes for advanced operational patterns like Autonomous Canary Releases, Multi-Region Failover, and Predictive Auto-Scaling, proving that `ninelives` can orchestrate stability at the system level.
