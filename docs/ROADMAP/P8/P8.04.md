# [P8.04] Advanced/Future Transports (MCP/GraphQL)

## Summary

This task serves as a placeholder for implementing more advanced or specialized transports beyond HTTP REST and gRPC, such as GraphQL or a Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Context

While HTTP REST and gRPC cover the majority of use cases, certain applications might benefit from other protocols. This task acknowledges these future possibilities without fully specifying them at this stage. It also provides a clear path for future extensions.

## Design (High-level)
- **GraphQL**: Potentially a `ninelives-graphql` crate. Provides a flexible query language for exposing control plane state and commands. Leverages `async-graphql` or similar.
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: A custom, lightweight binary protocol designed for specific, highly optimized scenarios, possibly for embedded or low-resource environments.

## Definition of Done (Placeholder)
- [ ] Research complete for one advanced transport (e.g., GraphQL).
- [ ] Initial design document (ADR) created for the chosen transport.

## Test Plan (Placeholder)
- [ ] N/A for initial placeholder, will be defined when chosen.

## Dependencies
- **Requires**: P8.01 (Command Serialization).
- **Enables**: Specialized integrations.
