# Phase 1: Observability Foundation

**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Executive Summary
*   **Story:** You cannot manage what you cannot see. Before we can build sophisticated resilience or control mechanisms, we must first give the system eyes and ears. This phase establishes the fundamental telemetry pipeline that permeates every layer of the framework.
*   **Outcome:** A fully instrumented system where every retry, circuit break, and timeout emits structured events to composable sinks, laying the groundwork for all future automation.

## Completed Tasks
All Phase 1 tasks are complete; detailed cards have been archived.
